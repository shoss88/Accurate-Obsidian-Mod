# Accurate-Obsidian-Mod
A minecraft mod for Fabric, Minecraft 1.19.4. This mod reworks obsidian in a way that it functions like it does in real life. 

* Obsidian is faster and easier to mine
* Obsidian can be mined by stone tools
* Obsidian drops obsidian chunks when mined with a pickaxe without the Silk Touch enchantment
* To create Obsidian again, surround a lava bucket with 8 obsidian chunks in a crafting table.
* Obsidian tools follows vanilla minecraft tools' recipes, but replaced with obsidian chunks, and sticks replaced with bones.
* Obsidian armor follows vanilla minecraft armor recipes, but replaced with obsidian chunks.
* Attacking with any obsidian tool inflicts a custom bleeding effect for 3 seconds, dealing 1 damage per 15 ticks.
